<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; text-align-last: center; padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px gi;"> I think Vinyl cutting is a form of digital fabrication because
you use CAD to help design the project for the vinyl cutter to cut out (making it a form of subtractive manufacturing). The definition for digital fabrication is a process that combines additive/subtractive manufacturing with CAD, I think vinyl cutting fits that definition perfectly.
Vector images are images made by a computer using math, while a raster image is an image made out of pixels.

  <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; text-align-last: center; padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px gi;">I chose the text because I love pokemon and Gotta cath'em all is the tagline. I chose the graphic that I did because it's of my first starter pokemon (the pokemon you pick at the begining of any pokemon game) : Oshawatt.
For the text I downloaded a pokemon font to my computer and then typed out the phrase. For the graphic I search on google images to find a blackand white design that I liked. Creating the design in Illustrator was relitivley easy all I did was found a picture of oshawatt online saved the file and uploaded it in to illustrator,downloaded the font typed out the saying that I wanted, and found a good placement for both.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; text-align-last: center; padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px gi;">After uploading the file to Sure Cuts A lot and making sure the design was in the lower righthand corner. I had to turn on the vinyl cutter and make sure the force 96g and align the neddle/knife part to be a centimeter away from the edge of the vinyl. After the design was cut I had to weed the design ( weeding is a process of seperating the  extra vinyl from the
  the design. After weeding I heated up the heat press to around 350 and ironed the shirt so could place my design easier. I then placed my design on the shirt and presed the top of the heat press down, till the design stuck to the shirt.It went fine, though the design didn't come out the way I had originally planned. As you can see in the illustrator photo there is a lot more detail in Oshawatt, but somehow I messed up either in Sure Cuts Alot or weeding and the graphic became a black shadow/outline 
In all honesty, I kinda love the mistake though, I think it somehow works better with the text than the original design, plus you can still clearly tell what pokemon it's supposed to be. Design file https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JXYCr1lqcX0-Ip-S0hKLNvBH2zlpKojX/view?usp=sharing </p>
